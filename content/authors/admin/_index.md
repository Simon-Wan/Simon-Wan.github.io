## About Me

I am a second-year PhD student of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington advised by [Natasha Jaques](https://natashajaques.ai/). Before UW, I received my bachelor degree in Computer Science and Technology from [YaoClass](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at Tsinghua University.

My primary research interest is to build AI models that can better understand human intentions and take actions in the real world.
